Once you run it get the localhost server information and copy and paste it the the url box in Postman. Add the name of the Controller minus the "Controller" portion of the file name. Then add the route name. Use this format (localhost/7126/controllernamehere/routenamehere). You will need to write a JSON format code in Postman under body/raw/JSON once in the JSON file input the JSON format code like this {"variablename" : "your input here"}.
