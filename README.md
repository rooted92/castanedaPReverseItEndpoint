# castanedaPReverseItEndpoint

Created endpoint that will call a function that reverses a word or number.

Peer Review by; Marcel R - The program worked well, it took a string and used a model for the input through JSON on Postman, and output it reversed. Solid implementation and well written! :D

User will input there word or number through the JSON type file ("wordNum" : "input here") in Postman then click on send. User will be returned there input in reversed form.

To run this program you must open Postman app. Then from IDE you use to open code file run the Debug. Once you run it get the localhost server information and copy and paste it the the url box in Postman. Add the name of the Controller minus the "Controller" portion of the file name. Then add the route name. Use this format (localhost/7126/controllernamehere/routenamehere). You will need to write a JSON format code in Postman under body/raw/JSON once in the JSON file input the JSON format code like this {"variablename" : "your input here"}. The "variablename" can be found under Models folder in IDE. After you finish inputing the JSON code click "send" next to the url box in Postman. You will then see the result in the Postman console.
